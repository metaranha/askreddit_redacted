Redacted comment CSS code:

1) Paste the contents of 'Redacted CSS' into your stylesheet.
2) Upload the contents of 'Images' to your CSS page. The names 
should already be corresponding, so you shoudln't have any errors
on save.


*Note:

the [id$='x'] values are identifiers for the last character in the comment ID. 
You can change the code around if you'd like in order to make the occurence of 
the redacted images more or less frequent. The maximum number of variables you 
can have is 36.
